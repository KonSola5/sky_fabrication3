#Size - the maximum length of the stalactite relative to the space between hill floor and ceiling,
#Max length - maximum length of a stalactite in blocks,
#Min height - minimum space between the hill floor and the stalactite to let it generate,
#Weight - how often it generates.

#For example: "minecraft:iron_ore 0.7 8 1 24" would add a stalactite equal to the default iron ore stalactite.
